We have not commented the classes in parser module. We believe that since we use the same methods
all the time it would be too much work to comment all of it. The methods given to us as precode is
also self-explainatory.

Some places we have commented to make it easier to follow are thinking. These are mostly special 
cases. As the call for function testIfToken() in PascalSyntax. It is called from the classes
ConstDeclPart, TypeDeclPart, VarDeclPart.

We hope this is enough.
